# My-Tango-Journal

I have been a multi-disciplinary dancer for many years now. I started my dancing journey in 2012 with my first lesson on some basic salsa steps. I do Salsa, Bachata, Meringue, Waltz, East and West coast swing. Last year, i stumbled upon Tango and i instantly got attracted towards this dance due to its complexity, precition and technique required for its execution.

Tango takes many years to become an advanced beginner or intermediate dancer. It has strict rules on what to do and not to do in Milongas. Many of them spend their lifetime perfecting tango.

This repository documents all tango techniques i have learnt over the course of last few years.

### Understanding Tango

(1) First, as a leader, we must have a very good understanding of what we want, (2) then have the ability to communicate the lead with your partner and (3) then give them time to execute the movements. 


### Basic Concepts: Posture, Embrace and Moving Together

* Body Posture
  * Shoulders - not crouching or relaxed back -- Balanced position with chest open [Front/Back]
  * Shoulders - not leaning left or right -- Balanced position in the middle [Left/Right]
  * Axis/Balance - not leaning forward or back - Center Position
  
* Embrace (Connection with Partner)
  * Leaders Right Hand / Right Arm - This is the space in which women dances, so that we make sure that our hands are very well placed on her back
  * Position of the hand - Depends on the body type, height of the partner etc. (Middle of the back, waist etc.). Make sure that we place our hands so that the placement entails maximum contact (flat). This ensures that women feel sense of security.
  * Parts used
    * Hand (Much contact along women's back) 
    * Inside of the forearm (Much contact along women's back)
  * Leaders Left Hand
    * We don't do much leading with left hand in traditional tango (With few exceptions) 
    * Used as reference point / point of stability
    * Reference point - Have a nice curvature of the arms and the height to be at Man's eye level
    
### Leading Tools in Tango

* Wrist
* Forearm
* Bicep area
* Inner Thigh
* Outer Thigh
* Inner Foot
* Outer Foot
    
### The Three Directions

* Forward
* Backward
* 2 Sides (Right and Left)

### Basic Tango Execution Pattern

* Sending the Partner first (Initiation)
* Waiting for the Partner to execute the movement
* Step with the Partner (End the movement exactly at the same time with the Partner)

From outside, this execution looks exactly like we do together, but we are always leading the partner first, before we step in tango.

### Body Levels

* Neutral Position
* Downward Position (Little bit lowered or relaxation in the knees)
* Upward Position - ONLY APPLIES TO WOMEN. Here the man can suspending the women upwards. He won't be suspending himself when suspending women.

### Change of Weight of the Body

The resposibility of the Man is to make sure that he is aware and leads/manages 
1. Axis
2. Steps
3. Awareness about weight of the leg

NOTE: Make sure that we shift the weight of the partner to one leg before any movement.(Most cases)

### Contain Vs Release

* Containing the Women vs the freedom to let the women do the movement.
* This must be done by adjusting the embrace - Either loose embrace vs tight embrace (Many degrees of variability depending on the movement)

### Different Energy

* Circular Energy - ( Example, Suspending women in one leg and turning women left and right)
* Square Energy - (Example, Square like U)

### Basic Tango Movements

* Basic types of walk Systems:
  * Parallel System - Torso in-front of the partner
  * Cross System - Position the body slightly to the side + slight release of the embrace (30% lets say)

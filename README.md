# My-Tango-Journal

I have been an multi-disciplinary dancer for many years now. I started my dancing journey in 2012 with the first lesson on how to do basic salsa steps. My curiosity with dance have helped me grow personally and professionally and it has many positive effects in my life. I do Salsa, Bachata, Meringue, Waltz, East and West coast swing. Last year, i stumbled upon Tango and i instantly got attracted towards this art due to its complexity, precition and technique required for its execution.

Tango takes many years to become an advanced beginner or intermediate dancer. It has strict rules on what to do and not to do in Milongas. Many of them spend lifetime perfecting tango.

This repository documents tnaog techniques i have learnt from many instructurs around US as a travel consultant.

### Understanding Tango

(1) First we must have a very good understanding of what we want, (2) then have the ability to communicate that with your partner and (3) then give them time to execute the movements. 


### Basic Concepts: Posture, Embrace and Moving Together

* Body Posture
  * Shoulders - not crouching or relaxed back -- Balanced position with chest open [Front/Back]
  * Shoulders - not leaning left or right -- Balanced position in the middle [Left/Right]
  * Axis/Balance - not leaning forward or back - Center Position
  
* Embrace (Connection with Partner)
  * Leaders Right Hand / Right Arm - This is the space in which women dances, so that we make sure that our hands are very well placed on her back
  * Position of the hand - Depends on the body type, height of the partner etc. (Middle of the back, waist etc.). Make sure that we place our hands so that the placement entails maximum contact (flat). This ensures that women feel sense of security.
  * Parts used:
    * Hand (Much contact along women's back) 
    * Inside of the forearm (Much contact along women's back)
  * Leaders Left Hand - 
    * We don't do much leading with left hand in traditional tango (With few exceptions) 
    * Used as reference point / point of stability
    * Reference point - Man's eye level
